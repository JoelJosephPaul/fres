Resource sharing app platform for students in college
This is an android app with a firebase realtime databse linked to it, currently its linked to my database, change it by add new database from firebase console
Have to implement authentication service
Students of a college can upload resorces available to them and other students when they need it can search it in the app instead of manually calling everyone
easier to keep a record of to whom the resource is lented to etc
